# hackerrank

Stating on 04 April 2023, I will start practing hackerrank problems.

Goal: To complete 100 challenges by the end of the year.

Main language will be Python 3 as it is relevant to my current work an consists of multiple libraries and simple language. Once I get competent enough, I will move to C++.

Good luck to me.
